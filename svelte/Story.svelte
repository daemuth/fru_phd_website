        speaks of unrest in Europe. The year is <strong>1922</strong>. </p>

            Day turns into night, the heat of the sun giving way to punishing cold. You wonder—in the
            <em>times-before</em>,
            had people climbed these dunes to watch the same stars? What kind of secrets did they tell them? Are you

          <p>There’s been darkness here yesterday, says the writer. You cannot figure out why. The coast stretches into
            the
            curve of the Earth, mountains like giants behind. There are people here. Life here. In the distance, you
            catch
            sight of the white triangle of a sail, and think—</p>
          <p>But memory is a curious thing. One moment, you’re standing on a ship and watch the sun rise above the mist.
            The
            next, there is sand under your feet, and in the distance, you hear the sound of laughter. The earmarked book

      <p>Dear Reader,</p>
      <p>Thank you for playing <em>Storymaker World</em>. This game has taken you through a reimagining of the novella
        <i>Heart
          of Darkness—</i>sort of. Rather than an adaptation, I like to think of it as a reverse interpretation of the
        novella’s cultural footprint: the image of Africa as it lives in our Western minds influenced by narratives that
        stretch from the days of empire to now, unwound through a transmedia story.</p>
      <p>The game <b><em>Heart</em></b> makes up the origin point of this temporal-narrative journey. This is the
        closest
        the story ever gets to touching its colonial inspiration. As you travelled through time into <b><em>From the
          Highlands to the Coast</em></b>, then—finally—to <b><em>Storymaker</em></b>, you have crossed a distance not
        only in time and place, but in thinking, too.</p>
